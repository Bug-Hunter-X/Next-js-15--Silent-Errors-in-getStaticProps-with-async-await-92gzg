In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `async/await` syntax within a custom `getStaticProps` function.  If an asynchronous operation within `getStaticProps` throws an error, and you're not properly handling that error, Next.js might not render an error page, leaving you with a blank page or a cryptic 500 error. This can be particularly tricky to debug because the error might not be logged to the console in a clear way.
